    "space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. it basically measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of the algorithm.\n",

    "# Algorithm Complexity and Measurement\n",
    "Algorithm Complexity refers to the quantitative measure of the resources required by an algorithm. similarly, algorithmic complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm would take to complete given input of size n. If an algorithm has to scale, it should compute the result within a finite and practical time bound even for large values of n. For this reason, complexity is calculated asymptotically as n approaches infinity. complexity is usually in terms of time, sometimes complexity is also analyzed in terms of space, which translates to the algorithm's memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement involves analyzing the algorithm's performance in terms of time and space. Algorithmic Measurement also refers to the process of evaluating and quantifying the performance and efficiency of algorithms. This measurement is crucial for understanding how well an algorithm performs in terms of resource usage, such as time and space, as the size of the input data changes. \n"
