    "1.\tIntroduction to Recursion \n",
    "•\tWhat is recursion? \n",
    "recursion is defined as a process which calls itself directly or indirectly and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tHow does recursion differ from iteration?\n",
    "A program is called recursive when an entity calls itself. A program is called iterative when there is a loop (or repetition).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhat are the key properties of a recursive function? \n",
    "The primary property of recursion is the ability to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems, each of which can be solved in the same way.\n",
    "A recursive function must have a base case or stopping criteria to avoid infinite recursion.\n",
    "Recursion involves calling the same function within itself, which leads to a call stack.\n",
    "Recursive functions may be less efficient than iterative solutions in terms of memory and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tHow does recursion utilize memory, and what is the role of the call stack?\n",
    "A call stack is a data structure used by computer programs to keep track of function calls. When a function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack. This frame contains information about the function call, such as the function arguments and the current position in the code. When the function completes its execution, the frame is removed from the call stack, and the program returns to the previous frame.\n",
    "The call stack is a critical component of memory management in programming, especially for function calls and recursion. It utilizes memory efficiently by allocating and deallocating stack frames as functions are called and completed. Understanding how the call stack works helps developers write better code and avoid common issues like stack overflow errors.\n",
    "Function Call Management: Tracks active function calls and supports nested calls by pushing and popping stack frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "importances of call stacks\n",
    "Memory Allocation: Allocates memory for function parameters, local variables, and return addresses in stack frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control Flow Management: Stores return addresses to ensure the program returns to the correct location after a function completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Recursion: Manages recursive calls by maintaining separate frames for each call, allowing independent execution contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling and Debugging: Provides stack traces for errors, helping identify the sequence of function calls that led to an issue.\n",
    " \n",
    "•\tWhy is a base condition necessary in recursion? \n",
    " Acts as a condition in Recursive Function, which tells the function when to stop. It is the most important part of every Recursion, because if we fail to include this condition it will result in infinite recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of using recursion?\n",
    "Advantages of Recursion\n",
    "Recursion can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n",
    "Recursive code can be more readable and easier to understand than iterative code.\n",
    "Recursion is essential for some algorithms and data structures.\n",
    "Also with recursion, we can reduce the length of code and become more readable and understandable to the user/ programmer.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Recursion\n",
    "Recursion can be less efficient than iterative solutions in terms of memory and performance.\n",
    "Recursive functions can be more challenging to debug and understand than iterative solutions.\n",
    "Recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhen should recursion be used instead of iteration?\n",
    "When the problem can be defined in terms of smaller subproblems (e.g., calculating factorial, Fibonacci numbers).\n",
    "For depth-first search (DFS) in trees and graphs, where recursion simplifies the traversal logic.\n",
    "In problems like N-Queens, Sudoku, or generating permutations, where exploring multiple paths is needed.(back tracing)\n",
    "For algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort, where the problem is divided into smaller parts recursively.\n",
    "When overlapping subproblems exist, recursion with memoization can be more efficient.\n",
